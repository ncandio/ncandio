## ðŸ“« Disclaimer
   
   With over 15 years of research in technology and corporate environments, my opinions on AI-driven and AI-assisted software are multifaceted. 
   I find the potential to refactor projects and ideas rapidly and quickly create exciting prototypes: this is the case with the PostgreSQL repository, implementing three 
   different branches. With a traditional version, using Dask and libuv for Python libraries, I have personally used it in enterprise projects.
   
   These GitHub repositories have been created as an attempt to assemble a portfolio and do not demonstrate my ability to build or lead production projects. 
   Naturally, given their recent creation, they reflect my curiosity for new technologies and available AI tools. However, all have been scrupulously reviewed, carefully 
   revised, and supervised. Without going into the details of each project and repository, each reflects my curiosity for a specific technological field or 
   the possibility of interconnecting complex systems. It should be noted that some, if not many, assisted coding tools available today are also provided by companies in 
   enterprise license form (e.g, Copilot for Enterprise)
